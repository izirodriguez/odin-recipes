    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These homemade Spaghetti-O's are an elevated version of the childhood classic, enhanced with a tasty sauce and Italian-style meatballs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces ring-shaped pasta</li>
        <li>30 ounces tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Cantanzaro herbs, (such as Savory Spice ShopÂ® Cantanzaro herbs)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>16 ounces Italian-style meatballs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly shaved Parmesan cheese, or as needed, for garnish</li>
        <li>fresh basil, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, drain pasta, and set aside. </li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce, Cantanzaro herbs, sugar, salt. and pepper to the pot; bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cut each meatball into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a mini meatball. Drop meatballs into sauce; simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes. If sauce seems too thick, thin out by adding pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time.</li>
        <li>Stir in cooked pasta rings. Garnish with basil leaves and Parmesan shavings and serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
