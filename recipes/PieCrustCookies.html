    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These easy pie crust cookies are flaky and buttery, with a delicious cinnamon sugar crust. The cinnamon sugar will make your kitchen smell like fall! Use any shape cookie cutter you like.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pre-made pie crust</li>
        <li>all purpose flour for dusting</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.</li>
        <li>Roll pre-made pie crust to 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly floured work surface, and cut using desired cookie cutter shapes.</li>
        <li>Transfer cut-outs to prepared baking sheets, leaving about a 1/2-inch space between each cookie. Repeat with remaining dough, rerolling scraps once.</li>
        <li>Whisk together egg and milk in a small bowl until combined. Using a pastry brush, brush the tops of each cookie evenly with egg mixture; discard remaining egg mixture. Whisk together sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl until evenly combined, sprinkle evenly over brushed cookies.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies, one baking sheet at a time, in the preheated oven until the edges and bottoms of cookies just become golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and brush tops of each cookie lightly with melted butter, let cool slightly on baking sheet, about 5 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
